### 3. A Buyer's POV 

#### Using the Search bar to search for products

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b98d419-dc5f-40cc-81b2-bc3e2603aac4)

- Both unlogged and logged users can access the search page to search for products.
- The search page consists of three parts:
  - Top Bar.
  - Search Bar: Allows users to enter search criteria by name or by selecting tags.
  - Products Displayed: Shows the products based on the search criteria or initial display.
- Initially, all products that are on sale will be displayed on the search page.

- **Search By Name**

  - Enter the text in the search text box. Note that the search is case-sensitive.
  - Click the search button.

Once logged in, one should see the "Shopping Cart" button.
Once you click it, you should see a list of all products that you have added to your cart, as well as the total price.

 currently selling). Then click "Add to shopping cart"
